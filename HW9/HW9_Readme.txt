HOSPITAL APP:

This Java project implements the Composite design pattern for a hospital application. It structures hospitals with departments and doctors using a tree-like hierarchy.

Structure:
HospitalComponent: Abstract class defining the common interface.
Doctor: Leaf class representing individual doctors.
Department: Composite class representing departments containing other departments or doctors.
HospitalApp: Client code demonstrating the pattern.

The Composite pattern allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In this implementation, the `Doctor` class represents the leaf nodes, and the `Department` class represents the composite nodes that can contain other departments or doctors.
